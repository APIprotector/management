# SmartBear API Difference Analyzer

## Project Overview

SmartBear provides a portfolio of trusted capabilities that give software development teams around the world visibility into end-to-end quality through test management and automation, API development lifecycle, and application stability, ensuring each software release is better than the last.

The API lifecycle refers to the timeline of changes in an Application Programming Interface (API), from initial design to implementation on clients and servers. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a document format used to define API structures. API designs are living documents that evolve frequently, especially during the early stages of development. Changes to an API’s structure may cause existing clients using previous versions to stop functioning properly.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to compare two API documents in OAS 2 or OAS 3 standards and highlights their differences using visual cues and natural language. The application should also warn users about the introduction of backward-incompatible changes, making it easier to assess the impact of planned API modifications. Generating natural language output may require the use of a language model.
